# Roopix AI — Personal AI Stylist & Virtual Try‑On

Upload a full‑body photo and receive expert outfit recommendations from a world‑class AI stylist. Explore Formal, Casual, and Stylish looks curated for your selected season and occasion, then generate photorealistic virtual try‑on images and save your favorites.

## Features

- Upload full‑body photo and analyze style context
- Select season and occasion to tailor results
- Curated outfit suggestions across Formal, Casual, Stylish
- Detailed rationale and garment manifest per outfit
- Virtual try‑on (three 1:1, photorealistic image variations)
- Local favorites gallery powered by IndexedDB
- Optional Supabase authentication (Google/GitHub) if configured

## Tech Stack

- React (`react`, `react-dom`)
- Vite (`vite`) + TypeScript
- Google Gemini via `@google/genai`
- Optional: Supabase Auth (`@supabase/auth-ui-react`) and `@supabase/supabase-js`
- IndexedDB for local persistence of favorites

## Quick Start

- Prerequisites: Node.js 18+ recommended
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Create `.env.local` in the project root with your credentials (see Environment Variables)
- Start development server: `npm run dev` (default on `http://localhost:3000`)
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Preview production build locally: `npm run preview`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root and set:

```
# Required — used by Google Gemini client
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_api_key

# Optional — only needed if you enable Supabase Auth
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_anon_or_service_key
```

- `vite.config.ts` injects `GEMINI_API_KEY` into `process.env.API_KEY` and `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` for client code.
- `services/geminiService.ts` reads `process.env.API_KEY`. If it’s missing, you’ll see “API_KEY environment variable not set.”
- `services/supabaseClient.ts` reads `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`. If missing and the Auth component is used, you’ll see “Supabase URL and anon key are required.”

## How It Works

- Home: Start from a marketing landing that explains capabilities.
- Upload: Choose a full‑body image to analyze.
- Season → Occasion: Pick contextual parameters that guide styling.
- Suggestions: Receive three curated categories (Formal, Casual, Stylish), each with three outfit variations, including rationale and item list.
- Virtual Try‑On: Generate three photorealistic square (1:1) images that preserve identity, lighting, and background.
- Favorites: Save generated images to a local IndexedDB gallery.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start development server
- `npm run build` — Build production assets
- `npm run preview` — Preview the production build locally

## Deployment

- Any static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages) works.
- Set environment variables in your host:
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required)
  - `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` (optional; only if using Auth)
- Ensure client env injection is supported (Vite will inline `process.env.*` based on your host’s env settings).

## Troubleshooting

- “API_KEY environment variable not set.”
  - Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is present in `.env.local` and your host’s env.
  - Restart the dev server after adding `.env.local`.

- “Supabase URL and anon key are required.”
  - Add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` or remove/avoid rendering the `Auth` component.

- Empty or invalid suggestions
  - Use a clear full‑body photo; try different season/occasion.
  - Check API quotas and rate limits in Google AI Studio.

- Port already in use
  - Vite runs on `3000` by default (see `vite.config.ts`). Free the port or change it.

## Privacy & Safety

- Uploaded images are processed to generate suggestions and try‑on images via Google Gemini.
- Do not commit `.env.local` or share API keys.
- Review your data handling obligations before deploying to production.

## Acknowledgements

- Built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Google Gemini.
- Optional authentication powered by Supabase.
